# BloodLink - Blood Donation App

BloodLink is a blood donation app aimed at connecting blood donors with those in need. The app utilizes Firebase for both real-time and Firestore databases to enable seamless communication between donors and recipients.   
This is a freelance project I created within a week in April 2024

## Features
